# Personalised Health Assistant (PHA)
* After the pandemic everyone started taking care of their personal health and being conscious. In this difficult situation they may not have a chance to go and visit the doctor for their issues.
* So, we developed PHA to assist users regarding their personal health. 
* We take the input from the user by asking the user to answer few questions and based on the user responses we inform him the issue he's suffering.
* PHA can accurately predict the issue the user is facing with just 10-15 questions.
* Even the chronic diseases like HIV are predicted accurately using PHA.
* As of now, PHA can predict 41 diseases accurately by cross verifying the 135 symptoms for every disease. 
* PHA is an end to end product that can assist the users to understand about their health in this hard times.
